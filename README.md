# Swastguru
The fast-paced world we live in today puts an increasing emphasis on individuals' health and well-being.

With the app Swast Guru, we can find out how many and what services are available in a hospital near us.

Our goal with this app is to explore the possibilities of using Python programming language and various libraries to create an intuitive and user-friendly app to help users in times of medical emergencies.
